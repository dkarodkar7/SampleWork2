      <p class="doc-lede">Writing is a critical part of the user experience. Even the best-designed product won&rsquo;t be usable to customers if the copy chosen for buttons, error messages and onscreen instructions is confusing, inaccurate or inconsistent. So treat your product&rsquo;s writing as seriously as you would any other aspect of its development.</p>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s Covered Here</h3>
      <p>This guidance deals with how to apply the overall Pitney Bowes brand voice to your products. In most cases this applies to the copy the user sees on the screen while using your responsive web or mobile apps &mdash; items like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting Started screens and welcome pages</li>
        <li>Navigation, dashboards and data visualization</li>
        <li>Headers, menus, buttons, inputs and other UI elements</li>
        <li>Error messages and copy for things like popovers and alerts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s Not Covered</h3>
      <p>Other user-facing materials are created by various different departments at Pitney Bowes, such as Marketing and Knowledge Management. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; and other customer emails</li>
        <li>Equipment manuals, Send Kits and other printed materials</li>
        <li>Help systems, FAQs and other online product support content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to coordinate with your colleagues in these other departments when launching a product to ensure that its writing is consistent across the entire communications spectrum and lifecycle.</p>
