      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>The “brand voice” defines how we talk to our customers through our products and other customer-facing communications. It’s there to help ensure that we go to market with a unified, consistently applied personality and style. This voice:</p>

        <li>Reflects the broader Pitney Bowes brand and value proposition</li>

        <li>Should apply end-to-end, at all key touchpoints in the customer experience</li>

    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>The Pitney Bowes brand personality has four attributes:</p>

      <h3>Smart</h3>
      <p>We communicate with the confidence and sensible style of an expert, always considerate and thought through, but never overly complex or technical. Our customers don’t have time to decipher jargon, so we keep our communications and experiences intelligent and intuitive — easy to understand and navigate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart is:</strong> expert, straightforward, confident, intuitive</li>
        <li><strong>Smart is not:</strong> technical, dry, arrogant, oversimplified</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Approachable</h3>
      <p>Living up to our reputation for trust and integrity means that we communicate with a tone that is honest, human and real. Our approach and style is genuine and accessible — always open and inclusive of our clients and each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Approachable is:</strong> genuine, conversational, grounded, human</li>
        <li><strong>Approachable is not:</strong> unrefined, overly familiar, dull, disingenuous	</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Ambitious</h3>
      <p>Our communications and experiences are both positive and uplifting. We focus on what can be, in addition to what is. Optimism without ambition is just hopeful, so we balance our optimistic tone with drive and determination, focusing on problem-solving. We can both dream it and deliver it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ambitious is:</strong> imaginative, refreshing, courageous, determined</li>
        <li><strong>Ambitious is not:</strong> impractical, bubbly, risky, dogmatic</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Energizing</h3>
      <p>We have an energy and momentum that’s contagious. While our competitors may be satisfied to deliver information, our communications and experiences inject an energy that’s nimble, motivating and inspiring.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energizing is:</strong> agile, spirited, inspiring, dynamic</li>
        <li><strong>Energizing is not:</strong> erratic, loud, whimsical, frenetic</li>
      </ul>
