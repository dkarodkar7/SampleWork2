      <h3>Don&rsquo;t Mix Terminology</h3>
      <p>When you mix terminology your users  might see three different terms for the same concept. Or they&rsquo;ll see a term that is sometimes capitalized, sometimes not. In either case, this confuses them and impacts their customer experience and our credibility.</p>

      <p>What also happens it that inconsistent terminology gets propagated across every piece of communication. Internal terms get externalized, or product features or names are changed in one place but not in others. It&rsquo;s much harder to track down and standardize terms after products have been released into market than it is when they&rsquo;re still under development.</p>

      <h3>Do Follow this One Rule</h3>
      <p>So if you keep just one rule in mind when creating and using terminology it&rsquo;s this: choose one customer-facing term and use it everywhere.</p>
